# Snake-Game
Create a classic Snake game in Python using the `pygame` library. Control the snake to eat food, grow longer, and avoid crashing into walls or itself. The game features smooth movement, colorful graphics, and increasing difficulty. A fun way to learn Python logic, loops, and game development basics.
